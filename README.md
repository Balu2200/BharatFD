-  WYSIWYG Editor Integration

Integrating a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor enhances the user experience by allowing users to format FAQ answers with rich text. This integration improves readability and presentation, making the content more engaging and accessible.

      - Installation and Integration Steps:
                
                -For this implementation, we will use Quill.js, a free, open-source WYSIWYG editor built for the modern web.
                -If you're using npm, install Quill.js by running
                     - npm install quill
                -Then, import Quill.js into your JavaScript file:
                     - import Quill from 'quill'
            
                - Integrate with Backend:
                        - When submitting the form, send the editor's content to your backend (e.g., Express.js) via an API endpoint.   Ensure that your backend is configured to handle HTML content appropriately.
