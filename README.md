    - CRUD operations for FAQs
    - WYSIWYG editor for rich-text formatting
    - Multilingual support
    - Redis caching for improved performance
    - Admin panel for managing FAQs

## Installation



## Features

- CRUD Operations for FAQs

    - Create: Add new FAQs with questions and answers.
    - Read: Retrieve a list of all FAQs.
    - Update: Modify existing FAQs.
    - Delete: Remove FAQs from the system.


-  WYSIWYG Editor Integration

Integrating a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor enhances the user experience by allowing users to format FAQ answers with rich text. This integration improves readability and presentation, making the content more engaging and accessible.

      - Installation and Integration Steps:
                
                -For this implementation, we will use Quill.js, a free, open-source WYSIWYG editor built for the modern web.
                -If you're using npm, install Quill.js by running
                     - npm install quill
                -Then, import Quill.js into your JavaScript file:
                     - import Quill from 'quill'
            
                - Integrate with Backend:
                        - When submitting the form, send the editor's content to your backend (e.g., Express.js) via an API endpoint.   Ensure that your backend is configured to handle HTML content appropriately.

- Redis Caching

To enhance application performance, Redis is utilized to cache frequently accessed FAQ data. This approach reduces database load and accelerates response times.

- Libraries and Tools:
   - Redis Server: An in-memory data structure store used as a cache.
   - Node.js Redis Client: A library to interface with the Redis server from a Node.js application.

    - Installation Steps:

       - Install Redis Server:

            - Windows: Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to install Redis.

        - Install Node.js Redis Client:

            - Use npm to install the Redis client library: npm install redis

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Integration

    - User Roles Definition:

        - The application defines multiple user roles with varying levels of access. Each role (e.g., Admin, User) has specific permissions assigned to it. The roles control who can post, read, update, or delete FAQs through the admin panel and API. Admins have full access, and users can only view FAQs and get FAQs.

    - Access Management for API Routes:

        - API routes are protected using role-based authentication, ensuring that users can only access the endpoints allowed for their assigned role. For instance, only users with the "Admin" or "User" roles can update or delete FAQ entries, while "User" role users are restricted to read-only access and get-FAQs.

    - Authorization Middleware:

        - Authorization middleware is implemented to check the user's role before granting access to specific API routes. This middleware verifies the role of the authenticated user and ensures that their permissions align with the requested operation, such as updating or deleting FAQs. This prevents unauthorized actions and enforces secure role-based access control across the application.
